            </div>
            <div class="article-body">
                <p>I love Georgia State University and helping others become passionate about our school. I know that State isnâ€™t perfect, but together, we can create immediate and lasting change. As President of Student Government Association, I intend to work on the following:</p><br>
                <button class="accordion"><i class="fas fa-plus-circle"></i> &nbsp;Transparency</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p><i>Improving transparency between Students and SGA</i></p>
                    <p>I intend on creating a web-based archive so that students may be able to stay in the loop of current initiatives and also, create their own requests. The archive would compile resources of Signal articles, SGA Senate Meetings, and Committee Meetings to allow students to see the progress on intiatives and what is needed next. This will put pressure on representatives to solve problems. In addition, this would allow SGA to move from administration to administration without a stop on current causes.</p>
                    <p>I also intend on improving transparency by having my own videos addressing current problems on campus and what SGA is doing to fix those. These will be similar to proposed video talks in the past; however, under my administration, they will happen. As Communications Director, I was able to create the first video that SGA at Georgia State University has had explaining our organization.</p>
                    <p>In addition to those tasks, I will ensure that SGA addresses Georgia State University's views towards major legislature in State Congress.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion"><i class="fas fa-plus-circle"></i> &nbsp;Student Involvement</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p><i>Increasing Student Involvement in SGA</i></p>
                  <p>I intend on mass recruiting students into SGA committees so that students can also be a part of this movement of change on campus. I intend on doing so by hosting a recruitment in Fall 2018 and advertising the benefits and possibilities to join SGA. To help incentivize students, we will create a structure for "Committee Members" to make it a criteria of members worth focusing more on.</p>
                  <p>In addition to this, I believe that we can solve problems in other ways than very long self-surveys. I hope to use more opportunities of speaking with students as an opportunity to figure out problems. We may do this through a competition for the best problems to fix on campus or such; however, the idea that students are not listened to enough is one I want to combat.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion"><i class="fas fa-plus-circle"></i> &nbsp;Transfer &amp; International Student Support</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p><i>Increasing Resources for Transfer &amp; International Students</i></p>
                  <p>I am extremely proud of the progress that this year's Transfer Liaison team has had in creating a structure for Transfer students to mix and mingle while receiving GSU merchandise. However, there needs to be more. We need to create better connections between in-state traditional students and international students. To do this, I plan on creating further connections between ISAC and Multi-Cultural Greek Life with Panhellenic.</p>
                </div>
                
                <button class="accordion"><i class="fas fa-plus-circle"></i> &nbsp;Innovated Student Services</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p><i>Panther Career Closet</i></p>
                  <p>I intend on creating a service for students to check-out professional clothing for interviews, internships, and career fairs and return it for no charge. I think it's important to have traditional programs such as these at an institution as large as ours. This program is already being created between efforts of mine and University Career Services. Soon, we will have a clothing drive to gain professional clothing towards making this a reality.</p>
                  <p><i>Resident Composting Program</i></p>
                  <p>Although, progress definitely needs to be made towards having more recycling opportunities throughout campus, I believe we can also create a program to allow students to use PantherDining's composting for their own endeavors. I am currently meeting with both RHA and PantherDining towards making this happen.</p>
                </div>
                
                <button class="accordion"><i class="fas fa-plus-circle"></i> &nbsp;Increased Connectivity</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p><i>Connecting Resources and Programs</i></p>
                  <p>I find the lack of connectivity and between Colleges, Campuses, and programs disastrous. I believe that we can fix these by pressuring administration together towards combining efforts whether that is internship fairs or meeting spaces.</p>
                  <p>I intend on creating GSU programs by interconnecting existing initiatives for specific colleges together. Georgia State University is home to all of us and if a certain resource is necessary by all of us, then we should all be able to use it.</p>
                </div>
                
                <button class="accordion"><i class="fas fa-plus-circle"></i> &nbsp;Environmentally Sustainable Solutions</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p><i>Creating Environmental Solutions</i></p>
                  <p>I am a firm believer in the idea that Georgia State University can be greener and incredibly sustainable. Whether that is through the new bio-diesel buses or through a composting program and increased recycling, I believe that we can really make a difference. I intend on continuing my work with Student Environmental Team towards being more sustainable on campus.</p>
                </div>
                
                <button class="accordion"><i class="fas fa-plus-circle"></i> &nbsp;Increasing Awareness for Mental Health</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p><i>Improving Awareness for Mental Health</i></p>
                  <p>It's incredibly important for us as students in competitive colleges to have appropriate access to Mental Health. This last year Atlanta-Campus SGA hosted a "Piece of Mind", an open dialogue on Mental Health &amp; Traumatic Experiences. Atlanta-Campus SGA also hosted finals week events designed to mitigate stress. I plan on continuing these programs and adding more to ensure that students know that SGA cares for each of them.</p>
                  <p>Connecting with sustainable solutions, we will advocate for increased greenery and more spaces for peace and calmness on each campus.</p>

                <button class="accordion"><i class="fas fa-plus-circle"></i> &nbsp;Continuing Successful Programs</button>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p><i>Continuing President Gray's Legacy</i></p>
                  <p>I often see campaigners neglect the programs put in place in favor of their own new ones. However, I believe that Corey Gray left remarkable ideas to follow. I intend on also having office hours at each of the campuses and being as interconnected as I can at each. I also intend on following his suit in creating change on campus by rallying students towards problems.</p>

                <br><br>
                <p>As President of SGA, I would be able to accomplish all of this by working together with students, organizations, and departments. <b>I invite you to watch this journey and hold me accountable and to truly count on SGA.</b></p>
