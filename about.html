                <p><b>I am running for President of Student Government Association (SGA)</b>, because I believe that I can make a change in the culture and future service through Student Government. As President, I will advocate for increased student leadership and effectively address my constituents’ concerns.</p>
                <p>I originally came from Suwanee, Georgia before attending Georgia State University. I attended Northview High School and enjoyed participating in organizations such as Future Business Leaders of America and FIRST Robotics Competition. As a Computer Science major in the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, I know that we can use technology towards solving a number of problems on campus and I intend on doing so through applications that benefit the student body.</p>
                <p>As a Presidential Scholar in the Honors College, I value the importance of each students’ education and the importance of making sure each student is taking full advantage of the numerous resources provided by GSU.</p>
                <p>Being a member of SGA has grown my love for service. I work tirelessly for my constituents. Within the past year of being actively involved in SGA, I’ve gone from Head Freshman Liaison to joining the Executive Board as the University-Wide Communications Director. I am the President of Collegiate Entrepreneurs’ Organization and a member of Student Environmental Team and Panther Hackers.</p>
                <p>I intend on being representative of all campuses; however, I also understand that not every campus is the same. Thus, I am committed to personalizing the experience towards creating the best solutions for each individual campus while also creating university-wide progress. I know that I will be available for every student regardless of campus because that is what Georgia State University students deserve.</p>
                <p>I know the passion that students have for this incredible university and how powerful we are as a student body in creating a legacy of change. <b>When we work together and we hold ourselves accountable, nothing can stop us. Count on me. Count on us.</b></p>
